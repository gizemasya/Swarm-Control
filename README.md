### This repository is only for saving and viewing the codes used in the Teknofest Swarm Robotics Competition.
- The codes belong to the third task, which is the fire extinction task.
- Fire coordinates are detected by using OpenCV library.
- The paths that the robots must follow to reach the fire are calculated with A* and assigned to each robot in the most optimal way by Hungarian algorithm.
